# 🚪 Login With...?

### *The ✨gold✨ standard of questionable authentication.*
Developed by yours truly, **Brent Kyrjeh Abenir**...because I forgot my security questions to change my password.

## 🤔 The Vision

This mini project is a modern, high-fidelity recreation of the legendary "unhinged login options" meme. I took the idea of 2010s internet chaos and wrapped it in a sleek, professional UI that screams, "I have my life together, but my security protocols are quite a nightmare."

*p.s. You will be greeted with a login page first. Click the <ins>Sign in Options</ins> text below the form.*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** For the structure (and the audacity).
* **CSS3:** To make logging in look like a Fortune 500 feature.
* **Pure Chaos:** The primary design philosophy.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap (Idea Lab)

Currently I am out of ideas and mobile data, but, I'd like to make this a fully functional and humorous login ~~options~~ page in the future.
In the meantime, I only consider this for portfolio purposes, but who knows? We can implement great nonsense stuffs soon!

* Improvements of UI/UX
* Additional functionalities
* Actual deployments, aside from the **HTML Preview** that is currently used
* RNG-related ideas??? THAT WOULD BE GREAT (as a gacha gamer it's an auto yes)

## 🤝 Contributing

If you have a login method that is even less efficient or more unprofessional than the ones currently listed, please feel free to open a **Pull Request**. 
We are looking for the worst ideas only.

### 💀 **Disclaimer**

*Please don't ask to add a login with your microwave, because I will not be responsible for burning or the failed authentication attempts.*
